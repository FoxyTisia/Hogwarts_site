            <h2>About Hogwarts</h2>
            <p>
                Hogwarts is a magical school where young witches and wizards learn how to master the art of magic. Located in Scotland, 
                this grand castle has been the home of magical education for over a thousand years. The founders of Hogwarts—Godric Gryffindor, 
                Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Helga Hufflepuff—each created a house that students are sorted into based on their qualities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The school is full of mysteries, including moving staircases, talking portraits, and secret passages. Hogwarts is also famous 
                for its enchanted grounds, which include the Forbidden Forest, the Black Lake, and the Quidditch pitch.

            <p>
                Hogwarts is located on a cliff overlooking the Black Lake. It is hidden from Muggle eyes by various magical charms and 
                enchantments, making it impossible for Muggles to find or recognize. The castle is equipped with many magical defenses, 
                including the Forbidden Forest on its grounds, which is home to magical creatures like centaurs, acromantulas, and unicorns.
